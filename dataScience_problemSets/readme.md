<body>
    This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the field of data science using Python programming language. 
    The course will cover the basics of data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling using popular Python libraries 
    such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and Numpy. The course will be taught using Jupyter notebooks, which will allow students to 
    interactively explore and analyze datasets.<br>
    Throughout the course, students will learn how to use Python to manipulate and analyze data, create visualizations, and build 
    statistical models. Topics covered in the course include data cleaning and preparation, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, 
    regression analysis, and machine learning.<br>
    By the end of the course, students will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of data science and be able to apply their 
    knowledge to real-world problems. They will also have gained experience working with popular Python libraries and be able to use 
    Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and visualization.<br>
